## What this plugin does

Each tool shells out to a Python script that self-manages its own shared virtual environment and downloads its own model weights on first use — no manual setup beyond what's listed in [Requirements](#requirements). One tool call in, one structured JSON result plus a preview image out. See the diagram at the top of this page for the full path from a chat message to a report/segmentation/classification result.

## Requirements

- A DeepSeek Harness `dsh` installation.
- **An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA.** These are multi-GB vision-language and segmentation models — CPU (`gpu: -1`, where a tool exposes it) works but is slow enough to be impractical for anything beyond a quick smoke test.
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), `git`, and Python 3 on `PATH` — every script bootstraps its own shared venv and, for BiomedParse, clones a repo and builds `detectron2` from source on first use.
- A HuggingFace account + `HF_TOKEN` set in the environment (or `huggingface-cli login` already done) for MAIRA-2 and MedGemma — both are gated models; nothing here can automate accepting that license for you. **BiomedParse and BiomedCLIP are not gated** — no token needed for those tools.

## Quick start

### 1. Install the plugin

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <your-profile> add github:weimengmeng1999/MedPlugin
```

Or from a local checkout (useful while developing this repo itself):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <your-profile> add /path/to/MedPlugin
```

Either form adds `dsh-medplugin` to your profile's `package.json` and installs `cordis.patch.yml` (mounting the plugin under id `medplugin`) automatically. Restart `dsh` (or your DSH Desktop/web session) afterward so the new bundle loads.

### 2. Just ask, in plain text

Nothing needs to be pre-built or downloaded first. Ask your agent something like:

> "Generate a radiology report for this chest X-ray: `/path/to/chest_xray.png`"

and it picks the matching tool itself. The first call for any given model/dependency group is slower — it creates the shared venv, downloads weights, and (for BiomedParse) clones a repo and builds `detectron2` — every call after that skips straight to inference. Run `dsh-medplugin doctor` any time to see exactly how far setup has progressed (see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)).

## Enable the vision route (paste an image)

Tools that take a 2D image (X-ray, ultrasound, retinal, and the classification/report tools) also accept a **pasted image** instead of a filesystem path — but only on the right model route.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Before pasting an image, open the model selector in the lower-right corner of the chat composer and choose the entry marked "+ MedPlugin Vision".**
>
> DSH rejects a pasted image on a text-only route (e.g. plain DeepSeek chat-completions) before any plugin sees it, because that route's catalog declares text-only input. MedPlugin registers a `<provider>-medplugin` twin route for every live provider that declares image input (e.g. `deepseek-official-medplugin`, shown as "DeepSeek + MedPlugin Vision" in the picker) — pick the twin, then paste normally. The twin follows the live model catalog; no restart needed when models change in Settings.

What happens under the hood: the twin rewrites the pasted image into a compact attachment-id marker before handing the turn to your normal text model (the chat UI still shows the real image); the model passes that id straight to a MedPlugin tool as `input`; the tool resolves it back to real bytes and hands a temp file path to the Python script. CT/MRI tools take NIfTI volumes or DICOM directories, so they always accept paths only — pasting doesn't apply there.

Set `wrapProviders: false` in the plugin config to disable the twin routes (see [Configure](#configure)).

## Usage examples

**Chest X-ray report:**
> "Generate a radiology report for this chest X-ray: `/path/to/chest_xray.png`"

calls `xray_report_medgemma`, `xray_report_maira`, or `xray_grounded_report_maira` when finding evidence/bounding boxes are useful.

**Find something specific, by name, on any of the five modalities:**
> "Segment the gallstone in this ultrasound image."
> "Are there any microaneurysms in this fundus photo?"

calls the matching `_segmentation_biomedparse` tool only when you ask for segmentation, masks, overlays, or localization. BiomedParse takes any free-text finding or anatomical structure, but its mask is localization, not diagnosis.

**Disambiguate a vague ultrasound request first:**
> "What's in this ultrasound before you segment anything?"

calls `ultrasound_classify_biomedclip` to narrow down anatomy/pathology, then a segmentation tool with the winning label as the prompt.

**Whole-body organ segmentation on a CT or MRI volume:**
> "Segment the liver and kidneys in this CT scan: `/path/to/scan.nii.gz`"

calls `ct_segmentation_totalseg` for the fixed anatomical-structure list, or `ct_segmentation_biomedparse` if you'd rather name a pathology than an organ.

**Prior-vs-current comparison:**
> "Compare this current chest X-ray to the prior one and describe interval change."

calls `xray_longitudinal_comparison` with both images.

## Tools

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/tools_overview.svg" width="100%" alt="Overview of MedPlugin's 15 tools across X-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound, and retinal (fundus), grouped by report generation, segmentation, and classification, each naming its backing model." />
</p>

`_totalseg` and `_biomedparse` on the same modality are complementary: TotalSegmentator segments a fixed list of named structures with no text prompt; BiomedParse segments whatever free-text prompt you give it, at the cost of needing you to name what you're looking for.

Every tool also attaches one or more preview PNGs to its result — inline in the chat on an image-capable route, or saved under `medplugin/previews/` in the session workspace on a text-only route.

## Adding a new tool

New tools should follow the existing pattern: a Python script under `skills/<modality>/`, a `SCRIPTS` entry plus `defineTool` registration in `index.js`, explicit agent-facing instructions in the tool `description`, optional preview attachment support, and package/test updates.

See [Adding a New Tool](ADDING_TOOLS.md) for the full step-by-step checklist and examples.

## Disable / re-enable

```yaml
- id: medplugin
  disabled: true
```

Set it back to `false` (or remove the line) to re-enable. Unloading removes the tools, the vision twin routes, and the settings surface; anything already written to the session workspace remains.

## Configure

Nothing is required — the plugin defaults to the `skills/` directory shipped inside this package. Override only if you want to point at a different copy of these scripts, in your profile's `cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- upsert:
    - id: medplugin
      config:
        skillsDir: /path/to/other/skills   # optional, default: this package's own skills/
        # pythonBin: python3               # optional, default "python3"
        # timeoutMs: 1800000                # optional, default 30 minutes
        # wrapProviders: true              # optional, default true — image-capable
        #                                  #   "<provider>-medplugin" twin routes
        # excludedProviders: []            # optional — provider ids never wrapped
```

## Troubleshooting

`dsh-medplugin doctor` checks this machine's setup without calling any model — whether `uv`/`git`/`python3` are on `PATH`, whether the shared venv exists, and how far BiomedParse's one-time setup has progressed:

```sh
cd ~/.dsh/profiles/<your-profile>
./node_modules/.bin/dsh-medplugin doctor
```

or, against a local checkout of this repo directly:

```sh
node /path/to/MedPlugin/lib/doctor-cli.js
```

```
skills/: /path/to/MedPlugin/skills
✓ uv — uv 0.10.7
✓ git — git version 2.34.1
✓ python3 — Python 3.12.12

✓ shared venv
    torch pin: torch==2.10.0
    torch 2.10.0+cu128, CUDA available: true

✓ BiomedParse repo cloned
✓ BiomedParse extra dependencies installed
✓ detectron2 built
✓ BiomedParse weights downloaded — 1.7GB
```

A `✗` line names exactly what's missing and why it matters. An unchecked BiomedParse line is not itself an error — that stage only runs on a `_biomedparse` tool's first call — but is the first place to look if such a call fails. Pass `--skills-dir <path>` if your profile overrides the plugin's default `skillsDir`.

## Scope

Two categories of specialist tool are deliberately not in this package:

- **Other model families** beyond MAIRA-2, MedGemma, TotalSegmentator, BiomedParse, and BiomedCLIP are technically fine — each would follow the same self-contained-venv pattern as the tools here — but are out of scope for this package.
- **Tube/line detection and bone-fracture classification** are excluded for a real technical reason on top of scope: their backing scripts have no isolated-venv bootstrap of their own — they'd import bare `torch`/`transformers` against whatever the ambient Python environment happens to provide, which can silently conflict with a pinned range like MAIRA-2's `transformers>=4.48,<4.52`.

If you want to add tools back in this style, follow [Adding a New Tool](ADDING_TOOLS.md): a `SCRIPTS` entry pointing at a script under `skills/<modality>/`, a matching `defineTool` registration whose `execute` shells out to it and parses its JSON stdout, explicit agent-facing tool instructions, and `skills/_bootstrap.py`'s bootstrap at the top of the script.
